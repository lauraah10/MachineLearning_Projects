## Using Kaggles census Data focusing on income
  1. **EDA_Statistical Analysis** : Is a complete detailed EDA and statistical analysis on census data from Kaggle on the social aspects impact/pattern with salary.
  2. **Clustring_DS7331**: Is uses the same data as EDA_Statistical, repeating essential EDA aspects to then performs different Clustering algorithms.
  3. **6Classificatoin_Models_..**: It is a follow up to EDA_statistical Analysis that performs the folloween 6 classification algorithms to predict income.
+ Model 1: Logistic Regression
+ Model 2: SVM
+ Model 3: Decision Tree Classifier
+ Model 4: Random Forest
+ Model 5: Naive-Bayes Bernoulli
+ Mdeol 6: KNN Cosine
  4. **SVM_LogisticReg**: Performs and SVM and logistic regression on the same Income data aiming to predict income. It also looks at the important features..
  5. **Shikha_lab_1_Adult_census**: Is another EDA performed for the same Income data. Some of these EDA was applied to to the final EDA_Statistical Analysis

## Uses Movie.csv data
  1. **JoiningData_for_Clustering**: attempt at aimming to cluster movies. This shows the inital steps at splitting the data.
  2. **Duy_Lab3_Clusterin and Duy_lab3_Clustereing_moviedata**: Performs EDA and clustering on movie data
